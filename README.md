# Feedback App

Basic React application that allows users to add, update and delete feedback. This application uses a mock REST API with json-server. Built as part of my [React Front to Back course](https://www.traversymedia.com/). This project introduced me to React fundamentals, including Components, JSX, Props (propTypes, defaultProps etc.), State (component and app level), events, rendering lists, the Context API etc.
